Quick Overview
==============

"Prowide Integrator" is a SWIFT messages development library, built on top of the open source library "Prowide Core".

It is intended for organizations looking for reduced efforts in the implementation and maintenance of its SWIFT software infrastructure. Especially suited to automate today's complex message flows.

The Integrator is distributed as an SDK with a range of optional modules. It can thus be tailored to fit your own SWIFT Integration needs. The SDK is the cornerstone of the package; as it implements the model and parser for both FIN MT and MX standards on which functional modules are implemented. Each optional module provides specific features.
